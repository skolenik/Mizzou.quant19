## Why I am here

![](confused.gif)

---

## Do as I say, not as I do

- High School in Math and Physics 1990
- MEEE 1996
- MSc Economics 1998
- Think tank economist 1998--2000
- PhD in Statistics 2005 (missing data in spatio-temporal models)
- Tenure track appointment at Mizzou 2005--2008
- Stata developer 2010--2012
- Survey statistician 2012--present

---

## How is industry experience different from academia?

--

- what is valued
- teams
- communication
- reporting and accountability

---

## My role

- survey statistics
- all of statistics
- some of data science
- workflows and reproducibility

---

## My take on software

- One rectangular data set, analysis leading up to a handful of regresion tables: Stata
- Develop and deploy algorithms on web: Python, Java
- Produce reports: R

---

## Building blocks of my workflow

- RMarkdown
- R tidyverse
- Version control
- Cheat sheets

Nicely packaged within RStudio

- Google and Twitter

---

## Markdown

![](markdown-everywhere.jpg)

## Markdown


When you make your text **bold**, or _italic_, or create

- items in lists
- and more items

you are marking certain elements of your text to be formated in a special way.
(The heading above is also marked text.)

Markdown modifies this to a very bare bones, text-only, no-mouse-selection-needed process.

---

## Markdown elements

```
`code`

_italics_

*bold*

### Heading 3

- unnumbered item

1. numbered item
```


---

## R Markdown

Additionally, R and some other languages can 

- incorporate source code 
- incorporate output, such as numbers, tables, and plots

... into Markdown documents

[Pew report](data/Pew-markdown-June16.html)

```{r countdown}
countdown(minutes=1,seconds=30)
```

---

## Do some data analysis in the middle of the presentation?

http://127.0.0.1:3921/

(Re-launch `Shiny-example.Rmd` if there is no server at that address.)

---

## Parametric markdown documents

The most advanced forms of markdown documents use inputs/parameters.

- Output format: HTML (the most flexible, and the only interactive), Word, PDF (requires LaTeX)
- Task to perform: analysis vs. reporting the results
- Input data files

```
library(here)
target_date <- 'June16'
rmarkdown::render(input=here("data","Pew-markdown.Rmd"),
  output_file = here("data", paste0("Pew-markdown-",target_date,".html")),
  params=list(data=target_date) )
```

---

## Copy-paste vs. markdown

![](copy-paste.jfif)

---

## Cheatsheets

https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

---

## Graphics

```
library(ggplot2)
```

and a myriad of extentions to it.

---

## Tables

```{r moe_table}
readRDS(here('KFF_MOE.Rds')) %>% 
  select(Group, `N (unweighted)`,MOE) %>%  
  kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

A lot of output looks like a table already

```
# aimed at HTML
library(kableExtra)
# aimed specifically at MS products
library(flextable)
```

---

## Take it anywhere

See examples at https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html

---

## Version control

---

## Version control

This talk:

https://github.com/skolenik/Mizzou.quant19

VCS training, of sorts (~1.5 hrs)

https://github.com/skolenik/shower-vcs

---

## Code version control in R

https://happygitwithr.com/ by @JennyBryan

- a reasonably complete introduction to using Git with RStudio

---

## Do something

```
x <- 1
y <- 2
```

---

## Takeaways (hopefully)

- Tools are important in both academia and industry
- Reproducible workflow is important
      + may take some extra time to set up, pays back handsomely when you need to redo
- No analysis without markdown
- No code without version control
- Presentations in Markdown
