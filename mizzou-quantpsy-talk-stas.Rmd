## Why I am here

![](confused.gif)

---

## Do as I say, not as I do

- MEEE 1996
- MSc Economics 1998
- Think tank economist 1998--2000
- PhD in Statistics 2005 (missing data in spatio-temporal models)
- Tenure track appointment at Mizzou 2005--2008
- Stata developer 2010--2012
- Survey statistician 2012--present

---

## How is industry experience different from academia?

- what is valued
- teams
- communication
- reporting and accountability

---

## My role

- survey statistics
- all of statistics
- some of data science
- workflows and reproducibility

---

## My take on software

- One rectangular data set, analysis leading up to a handful of regresion tables: Stata
- Develop and deploy algorithms on web: Python, Java
- Produce reports: R

---

## Building blocks of my workflow

- RMarkdown
- R tidyverse
- Version control
- Cheat sheets

Nicely packaged within RStudio

- Google and Twitter

---

## Markdown

## Markdown


When you make your text **bold**, or _italic_, or create

- items in lists
- and more items

you are marking certain elements of your text to be formated in a special way.
(The heading above is also marked text.)

Markdown modifies this to a very bare bones, text-only, no-mouse-selection-needed process.

## Data analysis withing a slide

```{r shiny_snippet, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
kmeans_cluster <- function(dataset) { 
  
  require(shiny)  
  
  shinyApp(
    ui = fluidPage(
      fluidRow(style = "padding-bottom: 20px;",
        column(4, selectInput('xcol', 'X Variable', names(dataset))),
        column(4, selectInput('ycol', 'Y Variable', names(dataset),
                              selected=names(dataset)[[2]])),
        column(4, numericInput('clusters', 'Cluster count', 3,
                               min = 1, max = 9))
      ),
      fluidRow(
        plotOutput('kmeans', height = "400px")  
      )
    ),
    
    server = function(input, output, session) {
      
      # Combine the selected variables into a new data frame
      selectedData <- reactive({
        dataset[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]
      })
      
      clusters <- reactive({
        kmeans(selectedData(), input$clusters)
      })
      
      output$kmeans <- renderPlot(height = 400, {
        par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 0, 1))
        plot(selectedData(),
             col = clusters()$cluster,
             pch = 20, cex = 3)
        points(clusters()$centers, pch = 4, cex = 4, lwd = 4)
      })
    },
    
    options = list(height = 500)
  )
}
kmeans_cluster(iris)
```

## Markdown elements

```
`code`

_italics_

*bold*

### Heading 3

- unnumbered item

1. numbered item
```


---

## R Markdown

Additionally, R and some other languages can 

- incorporate source code 
- incorporate output, such as numbers, tables, and plots

... into Markdown documents

[Pew report](Pew-markdown.html)

```{r countdown}
countdown(minutes=1,seconds=30)
```

---

## Parametric markdown documents

The most advanced forms of markdown documents use inputs/parameters.

- Output format: HTML (the most flexible, and the only interactive), Word, PDF (requires LaTeX)
- Task to perform: analysis vs. reporting the results
- Input data files

---

## Copy-paste vs. markdown

![](copy-paste.jfif)

---

## Tidyverse

https://www.tidyverse.org/

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

## Pipes to do steps in sequence

![](magritr.png)

## Verbs for data management tasks

What does this code do?

```
Pew_data %>% 
  filter(party5==1) %>%
  group_by(q1a) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
```

---

## Verbs for data management tasks

What does this code do?

```
Pew_data %>%            # data set
  filter(party5==1) %>% # select cases
  group_by(q1a) %>%     # set up a group variable 
  summarize(n=n())      # count
```

---

## Cheatsheets

https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

---

## Graphics

```
library(ggplot2)
```

and a myriad of extentions to it.

---

## Tables

```{r}
readRDS(here('KFF_MOE.Rds')) %>% 
  select(Group, `N (unweighted)`,MOE) %>%  
  kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

A lot of output looks like a table already

```
# aimed at HTML
library(kableExtra)
# aimed specifically at MS products
library(flextable)
```

---

## Version control

![](rainman.jpg)

---

## Version control

This talk:

https://github.com/skolenik/Mizzou.quant

VCS training, of sorts (~1.5 hrs)

https://github.com/skolenik/shower-vcs

---

## Code version control in R

https://happygitwithr.com/ by @JennyBryan

- a reasonably complete introduction to using Git with RStudio

---

## Do something

```
x <- 1
y <- 2
```

---

## Takeaways (hopefully)

- Tools are important in both academia and industry
- Reproducible workflow is important
      + may take some extra time to set up, pays back handsomely when you need to redo
- No analysis without markdown
- No code without version control
- Presentations in Markdown
