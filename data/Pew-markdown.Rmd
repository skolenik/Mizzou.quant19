# A template for analysis of Pew political polls data sets

This is an example of a stylized analysis of the data sets that have common variables.
I am using Pew Research Center data as they have similar structure and some common variables.
For full description and data use license, please see <http://www.people-press.org/datasets/2016/>.

The current analysis deals with `r params$data` data set.

## Required libraries

The basic functionality of `R` is fairly limited, so nearly any analysis requires loading additional
modules, referred to as libraries, that contain code developed by third party programmers
to manipulate data, produce graphs and tables, run statistical models, and more.
For this document, we would need the following libraries:

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(foreign)     # to read SPSS data sets
library(survey)      # to run analyses with weights
library(ggplot2)     # to produce plots
library(stringr)     # to manipulate the graph labels
library(here)        # to set up relative paths
```

## Loading the data

```{r usespss}
data_set_name <- paste0(params$data, " public.sav")
cat("Data set processed: ", data_set_name, "\n")
pew_data <- read.spss(here("data",data_set_name),to.data.frame=TRUE)
```

As we see from the warning output, not everything in R is fully compatible with SPSS.

## Sample sizes

This data set contains `r nrow(pew_data)` observations. The breakdown between landline and cellphones is
as follows:

```{r frame}
table(pew_data$sample)
```

## Analysis with weights

A common question asked in all Pew surveys is

> PARTY. In politics TODAY, do you consider yourself a
Republican, Democrat, or independent?

This is the weighted tabulation of that variable:

```{r svytab_party}
pew_data_w <- svydesign(~1,data=pew_data, weights=~weight)
(meanparty <- svymean(~party,pew_data_w))  
# the parenthesis is a way to both run the assignment and display results
```

This is the graphical representation:

```{r ggplot_party}
ggplot(data.frame(est=100*coef(meanparty),upci=100*(coef(meanparty)+2*SE(meanparty)),
                   loci=100*(coef(meanparty)-2*SE(meanparty)),
                   cat=str_replace(names(coef(meanparty)),"party","") ) ) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(x=cat,y=est,ymax=upci,ymin=loci)) +
  labs(x='Party ID',y='Percent %') + coord_flip()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. This document was produced on `r Sys.time()` using `r R.version.string`. The following packages were used:

* `foreign` package version `r packageVersion("foreign")`
* `survey` package version `r packageVersion("survey")` 
* `ggplot2` version `r packageVersion("ggplot2")`
* `stringr` version `r packageVersion("stringr")`
* `here` version `r packageVersion("here")`
